# Code Preserve

A project to preserve the public's code.

The United States government has been creating open sourcing software for years. With the recent adoption of a [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov), and with organizations like [18F](https://github.com/18F) and [CFPB](https://github.com/cfpb) having an open source by default policy, this has grown. 

But open source is not always interesting or useful at a particularly point in time. It may only become so far in the future and in ways its original authors did not intend. As both public and private policy becomes more algorithmic it may be useful as social, political, or policy documentation. This makes it even more important that code which becomes open source does not disappear. 

It is not inconceivable that changes in government could result in changes in open source policy, and code that was once publicly available may cease to be available. That is the risk that this project is designed to combat. By forking open source repositories that are in the public interest, and keeping those forks up-to-date, it is an attempt to assure that the most recent publicly available versions are available in perpetuity.
